# Sentiment Analysis using TextBlob and Vader Lexicon

This project demonstrates sentiment analysis using two popular NLP libraries: TextBlob and Vader Lexicon. The project includes examples of how to perform sentiment analysis using both libraries in Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks.

## Description

Sentiment analysis is the process of determining the emotional tone conveyed by a piece of text. This project uses TextBlob and Vader Lexicon to analyze the sentiment of text data, providing insights into the polarity (positive or negative sentiment) and subjectivity (degree of personal opinion).
